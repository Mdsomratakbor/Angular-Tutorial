### **Beginner-Level TypeScript Questions:**

1. **What is TypeScript, and how is it different from JavaScript?**  
   TypeScript is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript, adding features like type annotations, interfaces, and more. It compiles to plain JavaScript and helps catch errors at compile time rather than runtime.

2. **How do you declare types in TypeScript?**  
   Types can be declared using:
   ```typescript
   let name: string = 'Sam';
   let age: number = 25;
   let isActive: boolean = true;
   ```

3. **What is the `any` type in TypeScript, and when should it be used?**  
   The `any` type allows a variable to hold any type of value, useful for cases when the type is unknown. However, overusing `any` reduces the benefits of TypeScript's type safety.

4. **What is the difference between `interface` and `type` in TypeScript?**  
   - **Interface**: Defines the structure of objects, classes, or functions.
   - **Type**: Can define primitives, unions, intersections, and more complex types, not just objects.

5. **What are TypeScript Enums, and how do you define them?**  
   Enums define named constants.
   ```typescript
   enum Color { Red, Green, Blue }
   ```

6. **How do you define optional properties in an interface or type?**  
   Use the `?` operator to define optional properties.
   ```typescript
   interface Person { name: string; age?: number; }
   ```

7. **What are the benefits of using TypeScript over plain JavaScript?**  
   - Type safety
   - Early error detection
   - Better tooling (intellisense)
   - Easier refactoring
   - Improved code maintainability

8. **What is the `never` type in TypeScript?**  
   The `never` type represents values that never occur, often used in functions that throw errors or never return.
   ```typescript
   function throwError(): never { throw new Error("Error!"); }
   ```

9. **What is TypeScript’s `readonly` modifier, and how is it used?**  
   The `readonly` modifier prevents properties from being reassigned after initialization.
   ```typescript
   interface Point { readonly x: number; readonly y: number; }
   ```

10. **How does TypeScript’s type inference work?**  
    TypeScript infers the type based on the assigned value.
    ```typescript
    let message = "Hello";  // Inferred as string
    ```

11. **What are union types in TypeScript?**  
    Union types allow variables to hold multiple types using the `|` operator.
    ```typescript
    let id: string | number;
    ```

12. **What are type aliases in TypeScript?**  
    Type aliases define new names for existing types.
    ```typescript
    type ID = string | number;
    ```

13. **How does TypeScript handle `null` and `undefined` types?**  
    You can explicitly define `null` and `undefined` as types, or handle them using `strictNullChecks`.
    ```typescript
    let value: string | null;
    ```

14. **What is TypeScript’s `unknown` type, and how is it different from `any`?**  
    `unknown` is safer than `any` because it requires type checks before operations.
    ```typescript
    let value: unknown;
    if (typeof value === 'string') { console.log(value); }
    ```

15. **What is a tuple in TypeScript, and how is it different from an array?**  
    Tuples are fixed-length arrays with predefined types for each element.
    ```typescript
    let person: [string, number] = ['Sam', 25];
    ```

16. **What is type assertion in TypeScript, and when should it be used?**  
    Type assertions tell TypeScript to treat a value as a specific type.
    ```typescript
    let value: any = "hello";
    let strLength: number = (value as string).length;
    ```

17. **What is the purpose of the `void` type in TypeScript?**  
    `void` is used as the return type for functions that don’t return any value.
    ```typescript
    function logMessage(): void { console.log("Message"); }
    ```

18. **What is structural typing in TypeScript?**  
    TypeScript’s type system is structural, meaning that types are compatible based on their structure, not their explicit declarations.

19. **How does TypeScript handle function overloading?**  
    You can declare multiple signatures for the same function, but only one implementation.
    ```typescript
    function add(x: number, y: number): number;
    function add(x: string, y: string): string;
    function add(x: any, y: any): any { return x + y; }
    ```

20. **How do you declare and work with generics in TypeScript?**  
    Generics create reusable components that work with any data type.
    ```typescript
    function identity<T>(arg: T): T { return arg; }
    ```

---

### **Intermediate-Level TypeScript Questions:**

21. **What are generics in TypeScript, and how do they improve code reusability?**  
    Generics allow you to create reusable components with type safety for any data type.

22. **What are mapped types in TypeScript?**  
    Mapped types allow transforming existing types into new types.
    ```typescript
    type Readonly<T> = { [P in keyof T]: T[P]; }
    ```

23. **What is `keyof` in TypeScript, and how can it be used?**  
    `keyof` retrieves the keys of an object type as a union of string literal types.
    ```typescript
    type Person = { name: string; age: number; };
    let personKeys: keyof Person;  // "name" | "age"
    ```

24. **What are utility types in TypeScript?**  
    Utility types like `Partial<T>`, `Required<T>`, `Readonly<T>` simplify type manipulation.

25. **How do TypeScript’s `extends` and `implements` keywords differ in class inheritance?**  
    - `extends`: For class inheritance.
    - `implements`: Enforces interfaces on a class.

26. **What is TypeScript’s `this` type, and how is it useful?**  
    The `this` type refers to the current class instance and can be used in fluent APIs.

27. **What are discriminated unions in TypeScript?**  
    Discriminated unions use a common literal property to distinguish between object types.

28. **How does TypeScript handle intersection types?**  
    Intersection types combine multiple types into one, merging their properties.

29. **What is TypeScript’s module resolution process?**  
    TypeScript resolves modules by first checking locally and then following the Node.js resolution algorithm.

30. **How can you improve the build performance of large TypeScript projects?**  
    Use options like `skipLibCheck`, `incremental`, and `project references` to improve performance.

31. **How do you work with decorators in TypeScript, and what are their use cases?**  
    Decorators are functions that modify the behavior of classes, methods, or properties. They are commonly used in Angular.

32. **What is declaration merging in TypeScript?**  
    Declaration merging allows you to merge multiple declarations with the same name (like interfaces).

33. **What are conditional types in TypeScript?**  
    Conditional types use the syntax `T extends U ? X : Y` to create types based on conditions.

34. **How does TypeScript handle asynchronous programming with `async` and `await`?**  
    TypeScript uses `async` and `await` with Promises to manage asynchronous code flow.

35. **What is `Partial<T>` in TypeScript, and when should you use it?**  
    `Partial<T>` makes all properties of a type optional, useful for partial updates.

36. **What are type guards in TypeScript?**  
    Type guards like `typeof`, `instanceof`, and custom functions help narrow down types within code.

37. **What is TypeScript’s `infer` keyword, and how is it used?**  
    The `infer` keyword is used in conditional types to infer a type during type resolution.

38. **What is the difference between `public`, `private`, and `protected` access modifiers in TypeScript?**  
    - `public`: Accessible everywhere.
    - `private`: Accessible only within the class.
    - `protected`: Accessible within the class and its subclasses.

39. **How do you ensure type safety when using third-party libraries that don’t provide TypeScript types?**  
    Use `@types` packages or define custom type definitions using `declare`.

40. **What are module augmentation and ambient declarations in TypeScript?**  
    - **Module augmentation**: Allows you to add properties or methods to existing modules.
    - **Ambient declarations**: Provide type information for global or third-party libraries.

### **Advanced-Level TypeScript Questions:**

41. **How do you enforce immutability in TypeScript?**  
    Use `readonly` for properties and `ReadonlyArray<T>` for arrays to prevent modification.

42. **How do you implement advanced type-safe patterns such as builders or factories in TypeScript?**  
    Use generics, mapped types, and utility types to implement builders or factory patterns.

43. **What are template literal types in TypeScript, and how are they useful?**  
    Template literal types (introduced in TypeScript 4.1) allow you to concatenate string literal types.
    ```typescript
    type Name = `${string} ${string}`;
    ```

44. **What are conditional types and how do you create them?**  
    Conditional types use `T extends U ? X : Y` to define types that depend on other types.

45. **How do you create a type-safe API in TypeScript?**  
    Use interfaces and generics to define request and response objects, ensuring strong type checking.

46. **What are `never` and `void` types, and when would you use them?**  
    - `never`: For functions that throw errors or never return.
    - `void`: For functions that don’t return a value.

47. **How can you create a recursive type in TypeScript?**  
    Recursive types can be defined by having a type reference itself, such as for trees or nested structures.
    ```typescript
    type Tree<T> = { value: T; children?: Tree<T>[] };
    ```

48. **What are the differences between `Function` and `(...) => void` types in TypeScript?**  
    `Function` is a general type, while `(...) => void` explicitly defines the function signature. It’s better to use the explicit signature for type safety.

49. **How does TypeScript’s type system differ from other languages like Java or C#?**  
    TypeScript uses structural typing (based on the shape of objects), while languages like Java and C# use nominal typing (based on names).

50. **What is the `infer` keyword and how do you use it in conditional types?**  
    The `infer` keyword is used to infer types dynamically within conditional types.

51. **What is the purpose of `this` in TypeScript and how does it differ from JavaScript?**  
    In TypeScript, the `this` type helps enforce correct typing within classes and functions. It provides stronger type safety compared to JavaScript.

52. **How do you create a union type with a specific structure?**  
    Use unions with object types to define structures that allow multiple shapes.
    ```typescript
    type Animal = { type: 'dog'; breed: string } | { type: 'cat'; color: string };
    ```

53. **What are utility types in TypeScript and how can they simplify your code?**  
    Utility types like `Partial<T>`, `Readonly<T>`, `Pick<T, K>`, and `Omit<T, K>` simplify common type transformations.

54. **How can you use TypeScript with React (or another framework)?**  
    TypeScript can be integrated into frameworks like React by typing props, state, and context.
    ```typescript
    interface Props { name: string; }
    const Component: React.FC<Props> = ({ name }) => <div>{name}</div>;
    ```

55. **What is a type predicate, and how can it be used in a function?**  
    Type predicates narrow down types within functions, typically returning `value is Type`.
    ```typescript
    function isString(value: any): value is string { return typeof value === 'string'; }
    ```

56. **How do you implement polymorphism in TypeScript?**  
    Use interfaces, abstract classes, and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.

57. **What is the difference between a static type and a dynamic type in TypeScript?**  
    - **Static type**: Checked at compile-time.
    - **Dynamic type**: Checked at runtime.

58. **How can you create custom types in TypeScript using mapped types?**  
    Mapped types allow transforming object types by iterating over properties.
    ```typescript
    type Partial<T> = { [P in keyof T]?: T[P] };
    ```

59. **What are the implications of using `strictNullChecks` in TypeScript?**  
    When `strictNullChecks` is enabled, `null` and `undefined` must be explicitly handled, making the code more robust.

60. **How do you leverage namespaces in TypeScript?**  
    Use namespaces to organize and encapsulate code.
    ```typescript
    namespace Utilities {
      export function log(message: string) { console.log(message); }
    }
    ```

61. **How can you define global types or augment existing types in TypeScript?**  
    Use ambient declarations or module augmentation to define global types or extend existing ones.

62. **What are the advantages of using TypeScript in large-scale applications?**  
    TypeScript improves maintainability, scalability, and developer productivity through static type checking, enhanced tooling, and better refactoring capabilities.

63. **What is type inference and how does it work in TypeScript?**  
    TypeScript infers types automatically based on the context of the assigned value.

64. **How can you enforce function arguments to be a specific type using generics?**  
    Use generics to enforce specific types for function arguments and return values.

65. **How does TypeScript handle module loading and imports?**  
    TypeScript supports both CommonJS and ES Modules. Module loading can be configured using the `module` option in `tsconfig.json`.

66. **What is an ambient declaration in TypeScript?**  
    Ambient declarations (using `declare`) provide type information for global variables or external libraries without requiring actual implementation.

67. **What are decorators, and how do you implement them in TypeScript?**  
    Decorators modify the behavior of classes or methods and are often used in frameworks like Angular.

68. **How do you handle type compatibility and structural typing in TypeScript?**  
    TypeScript uses structural typing, meaning two types are compatible if their properties match, regardless of explicit declarations.

69. **What is the role of `@ts-ignore` and `@ts-expect-error` in TypeScript?**  
    - `@ts-ignore`: Suppresses TypeScript errors.
    - `@ts-expect-error`: Suppresses errors and expects an error. Useful for checking when you anticipate an error.

70. **How do you manage and install type definitions for third-party libraries?**  
    Use DefinitelyTyped packages (`@types`) or create custom type definitions if they don't exist.

### **Behavioral and Situational Questions:**

1. **Can you describe a challenging problem you solved using TypeScript?**  
   In one project, we were handling a complex API response that included deeply nested objects and optional fields. Initially, we used plain JavaScript, which resulted in frequent runtime errors due to missing or unexpected fields. Refactoring the codebase to TypeScript allowed us to define strict types for the API response, including optional and nullable fields. By leveraging TypeScript’s `Partial<T>` and `Nullable<T>`, we reduced runtime errors significantly. The codebase became more predictable, and errors were caught at compile-time, allowing us to fix potential issues before deployment. This improved the overall stability of the application.

2. **How do you stay updated with the latest TypeScript features and best practices?**  
   I stay updated by following TypeScript's official blog, reading release notes from GitHub for each new version, and staying active in TypeScript and JavaScript communities like Stack Overflow, Reddit, and Dev.to. I also subscribe to newsletters such as JavaScript Weekly, and I attend developer conferences and meetups whenever possible. Additionally, I frequently experiment with new TypeScript features in side projects and follow courses or workshops that focus on advanced TypeScript concepts.

3. **How would you refactor a large JavaScript codebase to TypeScript?**  
   When refactoring a large JavaScript codebase to TypeScript, I would adopt an incremental approach:
   - First, I’d configure TypeScript in the project, setting up `tsconfig.json` with minimal settings (`allowJs`, `checkJs`).
   - I’d then convert files one at a time, starting with the core parts of the application. 
   - Gradually, I would replace `.js` files with `.ts` files and begin adding explicit types to function parameters, return values, and complex objects.
   - For libraries without types, I would use `@types` packages or declare my own custom types.
   - To ensure smooth migration, I’d use `any` sparingly and refactor it over time to more specific types.
   - Throughout this process, I’d run the application’s test suite to ensure that the refactor does not introduce any breaking changes.

4. **Can you describe your experience with TypeScript in a team environment?**  
   Working with TypeScript in a team environment has greatly improved our collaboration. By using TypeScript, we are able to catch errors earlier in the development process. It enforces a shared understanding of data structures and reduces miscommunication about expected inputs and outputs. In code reviews, it has simplified discussions about function contracts and allowed the team to focus more on logic than on guessing types. TypeScript’s autocompletion and error highlighting have made the development process faster and more reliable, which in turn has improved our productivity as a team. We also use code-sharing features such as interfaces across modules to ensure consistency.

5. **What strategies do you use to ensure code quality and consistency in TypeScript projects?**  
   To ensure code quality and consistency in TypeScript projects, I implement several strategies:
   - **Linters**: I use ESLint with TypeScript-specific plugins to enforce consistent code style and catch potential bugs.
   - **Type-checking**: I run TypeScript’s type checker (`tsc`) as part of our CI pipeline to catch any type issues before merging.
   - **Formatters**: I use Prettier to maintain consistent code formatting across the entire project.
   - **Code reviews**: I encourage regular code reviews, where TypeScript’s static types help in understanding the code quickly and ensure that best practices are being followed.
   - **Automated tests**: I use tools like Jest to write unit tests, making sure types are correctly enforced and that new changes don’t break the existing logic.
   - **Strict Mode**: I enable TypeScript’s `strict` mode for more robust type checking.
   - **Documentation**: I maintain clear documentation and consistent naming conventions to make the code easier to navigate and maintain.

These strategies collectively help to maintain high standards of code quality in TypeScript projects.

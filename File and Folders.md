### Package.json file

`Both npm and yarn install the packages that are identified in a 
package.json
 file.

The CLI command ng new creates a package.json file when it creates the new workspace. This package.json is used by all projects in the workspace, including the initial application project that is created by the CLI when it creates the workspace.

Initially, this package.json includes a starter set of packages, some of which are required by Angular and others that support common application scenarios. You add packages to package.json as your application evolves. You may even remove some.`

## 1. Steps to Improve Angular Application Performance

To enhance an Angular application's performance, follow these steps:

- **Remove Unnecessary Libraries and Code**: Optimize your project by cleaning up unused imports, dependencies, and code.
- **Use `trackBy` in `ngFor` Loops**: Improve rendering performance by implementing `trackBy` to reduce unnecessary DOM re-renders.
- **Cache Static Files**: Leverage browser caching to store static files, reducing redundant network requests.
- **Utilize `ng-container`**: Use `ng-container` for applying structural directives without creating additional DOM elements.
- **Compress Image Sizes**: Optimize image file sizes to reduce load times.
- **Implement Lazy Loading**: Load modules on demand to minimize the initial load time.
- **Paginate or Use Infinite Scrolling**: Implement pagination or infinite scrolling to manage data loads efficiently.
- **Analyze Bundle Size**: Integrate tools like `webpack-bundle-analyzer` to investigate component and library sizes.
- **Change Detection Optimization**: Use `OnPush` change detection strategy to minimize the change detection cycle.

## 2. Methods for Sharing Data Between Components

Angular offers several approaches for sharing data between components:

- **Input/Output Binding**: Use `@Input` to pass data from a parent to a child component and `@Output` to emit events from a child to a parent.
- **ViewChild/ContentChild**: Access child components or projected content using these decorators.
- **Services**: Utilize Angular services to manage and share state between components.
- **State Management**: Use libraries like NgRx for centralized state management across components.

## 3. API Call in Constructor vs. `ngOnInit`

It is **technically possible** to call an API in the constructor of an Angular component, but it is not recommended.  
- **Best Practice**: Use the `ngOnInit` lifecycle hook for API calls as it ensures all Angular features, like dependency injection and input property bindings, are fully initialized.

## 4. Differences Between Standard and Standalone Components

| Feature                  | Standard Component            | Standalone Component                   |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **NgModule Requirement** | Must be included in an NgModule | Can be used independently without NgModule |
| **Importing Dependencies** | Declared in the NgModule      | Imported directly in the component file |

## 5. Preventing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- **Angular Interpolation/Property Binding**: Use Angular's built-in data binding mechanisms, which automatically sanitize inputs.
- **DomSanitizer**: Use the `DomSanitizer` service to sanitize dynamic HTML or other potentially dangerous content.

Example:  
```typescript
import { DomSanitizer, SecurityContext } from '@angular/platform-browser';

constructor(private sanitizer: DomSanitizer) {}

sanitizeInput(userInput: string) {
  return this.sanitizer.sanitize(SecurityContext.HTML, userInput);
}
```

- **Avoid `innerHTML`**: Prefer Angular's template syntax for dynamic content.

## 6. Host Binding and Host Listening

- **`@HostBinding`**: Bind a property of the host element to a component/directive property.
  
  Example:  
  ```typescript
  @HostBinding('style.color') color: string = 'blue';
  ```
  
- **`@HostListener`**: Listen to events on the host element.

  Example:  
  ```typescript
  @HostListener('click', ['$event']) onClick(event: Event) {
    console.log('Host clicked!', event);
  }
  ```

## 7. Implementation Example: Input Field with Length API Response

Key considerations for this task:
- **Reactive Forms**: Use Angular Reactive Forms for better validation and testing.
- **Security**: Use `DomSanitizer` to sanitize input.
- **Error Handling**: Implement `HttpClientInterceptor` and `ErrorHandler` for robust error handling.
- **Testing**: Write unit and e2e tests to ensure stability.
- **State Management**: Manage form state at the component level.

---

## 8. Angular Lifecycle Hooks

Angular provides **8 lifecycle hooks**. Commonly used ones are:
- **`ngOnInit`**: Initialize variables and make API calls.
- **`ngOnDestroy`**: Clean up subscriptions to prevent memory leaks.
- **`ngOnChanges`**: Handle changes to input properties.
- **`ngAfterViewInit`**: Execute logic after the view is fully initialized.

---

## 9. Dependency Injection (DI) in Angular

Dependency Injection (DI) is a **design pattern** used extensively in Angular:
- **Purpose**: Improves testability and maintains loose coupling between components and their dependencies.
- **Singleton Services**: Angular creates a single instance of services across the application.
- **Implementation**: Constructor-based DI from Angular 2 onwards.

## 10. Experience with Angular

Angular has evolved significantly:
- **Angular 2**: Introduced component-based architecture.
- **Angular 5**: Introduced `HttpClient`.
- **Angular 8**: Introduced Ivy engine.
- **Angular 15/17**: Added standalone components and built-in control flow mechanisms.

**My Experience**: I have worked with Angular since version 2 and have adapted to new features like Ivy, standalone components, and Angular Signals.

## 11. Handling Client-Specific Design Requirements

For scenarios with different designs for clients (e.g., USA and Europe):
- Use **separate environment files** for configurations.
- Build the application using specific configurations:  
  ```bash
  ng build --configuration=usa
  ng build --configuration=european
  ```

Deploy the builds to respective servers.

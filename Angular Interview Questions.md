### 1. What is Angular? Why was it introduced?
`Angular was introduced to create Single Page applications. This framework brings structure and consistency to web applications and provides excellent scalability and 
maintainability.`

`Angular is an open-source, JavaScript framework wholly written in TypeScript. It uses HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly.`

### 2. What is TypeScript?
`TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that offers excellent consistency. It is highly recommended, as it provides some syntactic sugar and makes the code base more comfortable to understand and maintain. Ultimately, TypeScript code compiles down to JavaScript that can run efficiently in any environment.`

### 3. What is data binding? Which type of data binding does Angular deploy?
`Data binding is a phenomenon that allows any internet user to manipulate Web page elements using a Web browser. It uses dynamic HTML and does not require complex scripting or programming. We use data binding in web pages that contain interactive components such as forms, calculators, tutorials, and games. Incremental display of a webpage makes data binding convenient when pages have an enormous amount of data.` 

`Angular uses the two-way binding. Any changes made to the user interface are reflected in the corresponding model state. Conversely, any changes in the model state are reflected in the UI state. This allows the framework to connect the DOM to the Model data via the controller. However, this approach affects performance since every change in the DOM has to be tracked.`

### 4. What are Single Page Applications (SPA)?
`Single-page applications are web applications that load once with new features just being mere additions to the user interface. It does not load new HTML pages to display the new page's content, instead generated dynamically. This is made possible through JavaScript's ability to manipulate the DOM elements on the existing page itself. A SPA approach is faster, thus providing a seamless user experience`

### 5. What are decorators in Angular? 
Decorators are a design pattern or functions that define how Angular features work. They are used to make prior modifications to a class, service, or filter. Angular supports four types of decorators, they are:

- Class Decorators
- Property Decorators
- Method Decorators
- Parameter Decorators

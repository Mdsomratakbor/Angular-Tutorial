# What is the difference between declarations, providers, and import in NgModule?


**DECLARATIONS**
`Example:`

<pre>declarations: [AppComponent]</pre>

**What can we inject here? Components, pipes, directives**

**IMPORTS**
`Example:`

<pre>imports: [BrowserModule, AppRoutingModule]</pre>

**What can we inject here? other modules**

**PROVIDERS**
`Example:`

<pre>providers: [UserService]</pre>

**What can we inject here? services**

**BOOTSTRAP**
`Example:`

<pre>bootstrap: [AppComponent]</pre>

**What can we inject here? the main component that will be generated by this module (top parent node for a component tree)**

**ENTRY COMPONENTS**
`Example:`

<pre>entryComponents: [PopupComponent]</pre>

**What can we inject here? dynamically generated components (for instance by using ViewContainerRef.createComponent())**

**EXPORT**
`Example:`

<pre>export: [TextDirective, PopupComponent, BrowserModule]</pre>

**What can we inject here? components, directives, modules or pipes that we would like to have access to them in another module (after importing this module)**

### Angular Components Overview

`Components are the main building block for Angular applications. Each component consists of:`

- An HTML template that declares what renders on the page
- A Typescript class that defines behavior
- A CSS selector that defines how the component is used in a template
- Optionally, CSS styles applied to the template

### Creating a component

`The best way to create a component is with the Angular CLI. You can also create a component manually`


**Creating a component using the Angular CLI**
**To create a component using the Angular CLI:**

  `From a terminal window, navigate to the directory containing your application.`
`Run the ng generate component <component-name> command, where <component-name> is the name of your new component.
By default, this command creates the following:`

- A folder named after the component
- A component file, <component-name>.component.ts
- A template file, <component-name>.component.html
- A CSS file, <component-name>.component.css
- A testing specification file, <component-name>.component.spec.ts
`Where <component-name> is the name of your component.`
